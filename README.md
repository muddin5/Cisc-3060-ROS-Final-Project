By using ROS, a partner and I had to write a python code that used OpenCV to navigate a simulation of a T3 bot. The bot would explore a walled off environment, 
with 4 colored walls and 4 obstacles in the middle, visit each colored wall in order, and avoid obstacles while approaching and screenshotting each wall, each 
image capture holding a timestamp for how many seconds it took to capture it from when the simulation was started.
